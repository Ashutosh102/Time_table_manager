      <p>Having a proper Time Table is also a key to Success!</p>
      <br>
      <p> We all have 24-hours in a day. <br>But, why does it seem that some
          people are able to get the most out of every minute of the day?<br>
          Believe it or not, they dont have the power to slow down time.
          They do, however, know how to properly manage their time.<br><br>
          So it's better to plan the next day just before going to bed!
          <br><br><br></p> <hr>

           plan your 'what to do' for Tommorow!</p><br>
